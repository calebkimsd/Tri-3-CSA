Worked on implementing our [Upload](https://github.com/zenxha/musicgacha/tree/main/src/main/java/com/musicgacha/controllers/database/upload) page where you can upload your own gacha character and display descriptions and rarity specialties.
      Updated [Upload Controller](https://github.com/zenxha/musicgacha/blob/main/src/main/java/com/musicgacha/controllers/database/upload/UploadController.java) to display to inputed data into a card view standard.

           Group was able to guide me through [JSON](https://github.com/zenxha/musicgacha/tree/main/src/main/resources/static/json) characters/songs and using these                "characters" to use in our project. 
           
   It was fun to move out of simple Java such as just for loops and if statements and start to dive deeper into the challenging content.
