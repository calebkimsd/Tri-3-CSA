# Test Plans:
- Study Group with Chris & Komay
- 
- Planning to get on weekly call and review CB units that we find difficult. 
- 
- Find practice MC & FRQ CB problems online and solve them. 
- 
- Recalling back to Trimester 1 journal to read over notes and refine them as well (also the vocab check from 2nd trimester).
- 
- Ask lots of questions to clear misunderstandings and missed concepts.
