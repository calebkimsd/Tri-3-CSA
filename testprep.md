# Test Plans:
- Study Group with Chris & Komay

- Planning to get on weekly call and review CB units that we find difficult. 

- Find practice MC & FRQ CB problems online and solve them. 

- Recalling back to Trimester 1 journal to read over notes and refine them as well (also the vocab check from 2nd trimester).

- Ask lots of questions to clear misunderstandings and missed concepts.


# Test Prep Resources: 

## [Trimester 1 College Board Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/135DrnlGz_x3aS1VKtcEAPxDL_fop-vf0kh6IHFR8n9M/edit#heading=h.e4p0tpkxp00v) 

- Detailed notes from each CB unit. 
- MC question answers/corrections to look back for practice. 
- Code Snippets from CB and explantation of them. 

## [Trimester 2 Vocabulary Review](https://github.com/ChristopherDuroiu/usb-c/wiki/Caleb-&-Chris-Tech-Talk-6-Vocab)

- Lists key vocabulary terms and then a definition with a code example. 
- Easy to understand vocab terms because we created them ourselves.
- Not all will be tested on the College Board exam but all of them are useful as we grow in computer science.
