| Remove unused imports | [Link 1](https://github.com/calebkimsd/Tri-3-CSA/commit/6d50afc033d54276dc8eab6bff943c159558f67a), [Link 2](https://github.com/calebkimsd/Tri-3-CSA/commit/09ff5ee746c8f30897115a1904b6096cbd771803) | Caleb, in computer science it is best to avoid unused imports. We want clean & concise code. Having unused imports makes files unnecessarily long and unorganized.  |
| Replace redundant if statements w/ concise Switch statement | [Link](https://github.com/calebkimsd/Tri-3-CSA/commit/b67e86a5441504a3d054a1189c747864030d8cda) | It is best practice in CS to avoid redundant if statements. To be more concise, we can use a clean switch statement. This allows other programmers to more easily understand your code. It also makes it a lot easier to edit later on. Long if statements can be extremely tedious to add on to.  |

Overall Summary / Conclusion: Great job overall. I spent over an hour looking through your code and I could only find small and tedious things to change. Your code tends to be very concise and you are using the best methods & approaches to complete the tasks. Furthermore, I really liked your comments. They help other programmers understand your methods. Without your comments, I likely would have had to spend extra time understanding your methods. Good job!
